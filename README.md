**SQL Mini Project — IDC 21-Day SQL Challenge**

Welcome to my solution for the Great Pizza Analytics Challenge, completed as part of the IDC 21-Day SQL Challenge.
This project explores SQL fundamentals to advanced querying using a real-world styled pizza sales dataset.

**📊 Project Overview**

As the data analyst for IDC Pizza, I worked with multiple relational tables:

pizza_types, pizzas, orders, order_details

**The project includes answering 14 SQL-based analytical tasks across three phases:**

**Phase 1 — Foundation & Inspection**

1.Distinct values
2. NULL handling with COALESCE
3. Basic filtering

**Phase 2 — Filtering & Exploration**
1.. Date/time filtering
2. Pattern matching
3. Price filtering
4. IN / BETWEEN / LIKE operators

**Phase 3 — Sales Performance & Joins**

1. SUM, AVG, COUNT
2. GROUP BY + HAVING
3. INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, SELF JOIN
4. Identifying pizzas never ordered
5.Price comparison across sizes
6.Multi-table relationship queries

All answers are included as SQL queries in my final submission CSV.

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**
MySQL (compatible with PostgreSQL)
SQL Joins & Aggregations
Database restoration (.dump / .sql)
Data Cleaning (NULLs, DISTINCT, COALESCE)
